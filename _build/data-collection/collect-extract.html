<p>As we have seen in the previous section, the data collection and cleaning process is the most crucial and challenging stage in the data science lifecycle. In this section, we will explore a few statistical and mathematical justifications for the various sampling and estimation methods we use for building our sampling dataset. We will also walk through how to use some of the existent Python libraries to implement these methods.</p>
<p>The section is divided into the following subsections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarizing Data</li>
<li>Statistical Methods in Sampling</li>
<li>Simple Random Sampling</li>
<li>Population Variance and the Bootstrap Method</li>
<li>Empirical Risks and Risk Minimization</li>
<li>Web Technologies</li>
<li>Text Processing Methods</li>
</ul>
