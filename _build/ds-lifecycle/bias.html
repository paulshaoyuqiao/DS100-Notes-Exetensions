<h1 id="Sampling-Bias">Sampling Bias<a class="anchor-link" href="#Sampling-Bias"> </a></h1><p>During the data collection process, we sometimes risk imposing <strong>sampling bias</strong> on the dataset we gather.</p>
<p>More precisely, <strong>sampling bias</strong> is a bias where among all the samples we have collected in the dataset, <strong>some members have a lower sampling probably than others</strong>. Intuitively, it means that if we randomly choose one sample from the dataset, some samples have a higher chance of being chosen than others.</p>
<p>You may wonder that realistic, shouldn't all samples be unique? Theoretically, yes; but practically speaking, each individual sample we collect is really just <strong>an individual collection of characteristics (factors) we observe/measure</strong>. This means <strong>we cannot comprehensively cover every characteristic for each sample (and we probably won't either, for ones that don't really address our problems)</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>sampling bias</strong> results in a biased sample, which can cause our model to predict differently and erroneously about the true population (because of the un-even distribution within our sampling dataset). What concerns us more is the fact that when people aren't aware of this bias, <strong>they can falsely attribute the results to the phenomenon in the study and infer something intrinsically wrong about the samples rather than raise doubts about the method of sampling</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="Types-of-Sampling-Bias">Types of Sampling Bias<a class="anchor-link" href="#Types-of-Sampling-Bias"> </a></h1><p>Here's a few different sampling biases that results from different stages in an experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection from a <strong>specific location</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-selection bias</strong>:<ul>
<li>This means in the conducted experiment, <strong>the participants have forms of control over whether to actually participate</strong>. </li>
<li>Their decision to participate may actually <strong>correlate with features of the model, which makes the participants a non-representative and non-generalizable sample</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exclusion bias</strong>:<ul>
<li>This happens when we <strong>exclude particular groups from the sample</strong>.</li>
<li>This usually occurs not because we intentionally avoid their representation in the sample databset (hopefully), but we <strong>have great difficulty (high cost / rare to access and measure / lack of response ) obtaining valid data for those particular groups</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Survivorship bias</strong>:<ul>
<li>This happens when we only select the "surviving" objects to be included in the dataset, neglecting those that fell out of view.</li>
<li>A concrete example could be: if we build a model that analyze the factors contributing to the profit margins of pharmaceutical companies, we will likely only have access largely to <strong>detailed financial records of the current companies in the market</strong>, <strong>not the ones that have closed down</strong>. However, those who close down could contain equally valuable information for us to build an accurate model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
