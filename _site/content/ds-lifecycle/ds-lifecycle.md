We will also take a look at a few interesting cases where proper (or improper) use of data science methods have significantly impacted the process and conclusion of the studies.

By the end of this section, you should be able to understand and answer the following questions:
* What is the **data science lifecycle**?
* What are the **key components in the lifecycle**? What tools can help us complete this lifecycle?
* What are some of the **present-day challenges in data science**?
* What is **sampling bias**? How do we avoid it?
* In the context of human ethics, how can we, as data scientists/analysts, conduct and promote impartial and respectful studies/researches?
