# Data 100 Notes & Extensions

Hi! My name is Paul Shao, currently a lead uGSI at UC Berkeley for an upper-div data science course **Principles & Techniques of Data Science** (`Data 100`). This book is a compilation of notes that I provided to my students when teaching discussion/lab sections for the course. I want to provide a short disclaimer that **this book is by no means a substitute for the materials taught in Data 100**, it is more meant supplement the course content and to provide some additional perspectives and extensions to students who wish to explore more around some of the topics touched on in class.
